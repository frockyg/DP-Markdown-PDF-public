## Quick facts

Badajoz is a city in southwest Spain known for its Moorish historic quarter with the fortresslike Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. Overlooking the city, the Alcazaba of Badajoz is a Moorish citadel with fortified walls and verdant gardens. It also encompasses the Provincial Archaeological Museum and the 12th-century Espantaperros Tower. Castelar Park features palm trees and statues of local cultural figures.  

Badajoz is *our* top recommendation as a Spain travel destination this year.
